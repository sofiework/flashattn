# CS 7295 GPU Project 4: Implementing a self-attention kernel in CUDA

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) are being widely used across numerous applications. The key model architecture powering these LLMs is the Transformer, which relies on a fundamental component known as the self-attention operation. In this project, we will delve into the mechanics of how the attention operation works. The primary goal is to implement a highly optimized CUDA kernel for this operation, specifically targeting the FlashAttention algorithm.

## Background

### Self-attention

Attention is a powerful operation first introduced in the "Attention Is All You Need" paper [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). The basic operation defines a relationship between three matrices: **Query (Q)**, **Key (K)**, and **Value (V)**. The output is calculated using the following formula:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d}}\right)V
,$$

where $d$ is the dimension of the key and query vectors. This scaling factor is used to prevent the dot products from growing too large, which could otherwise saturate the softmax function and destabilize training.

**Self-attention** is a specific application of this operation where the Q, K, and V matrices are all generated from the **same input sequence, $X$**.

In the context of language models, this input sequence $X$ typically represents a sentence or a batch of sentences. Each word in the sentence is first split into tokens. An embedding layer then maps each token into a high-dimensional vector in an embedding space. This process results in the input tensor $X$ having a dimension of `[batch_size, seq_len, hidden_dim]`.

From this single input $X$, the Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) matrices are generated through linear projections. This is done by multiplying $X$ with three distinct, learnable weight matrices ($W_Q$, $W_K$, and $W_V$):

* **Query:** $Q = X \cdot W_Q$
* **Key:** $K = X \cdot W_K$
* **Value:** $V = X \cdot W_V$

Each of these weight matrices ($W_Q$, $W_K$, $W_V$) typically has a dimension of `[hidden_dim, hidden_dim]`. This means that Q, K, and V will also have the same shape as $X$ (`[batch_size, seq_len, hidden_dim]`), effectively projecting the input embeddings into three different "representation subspaces" required for the attention operation.

### Causal attention

In many Transformer models, such as those used for text generation, we must ensure that tokens can only attend to **previous tokens** in the sequence. This is achieved by applying a **causal mask** (also known as a look-ahead mask) to the score matrix ($QK^T$).

This mask is applied to the score matrix *before* the softmax operation. By setting all elements corresponding to future tokens to negative infinity, we ensure that a token at a given position cannot "see" or attend to any tokens that come after it.

### Multi-headed attention (MHA)

To allow the model to learn richer representations, we want each token to attend to other tokens in multiple contexts or "representation subspaces." This is the goal of **Multi-headed Attention (MHA)**, which runs multiple self-attention operations in parallel.

Instead of performing $h$ separate projections for $h$ heads, it's far more efficient to:
1.  Perform one large linear projection for each of Q, K, and V (using $W_Q, W_K, W_V$ as described previously).
2.  "Split" the resulting $Q$, $K$, and $V$ matrices into $h$ heads.

This "split" is typically a tensor reshape, where the `hidden_dim` (or $d_{\text{model}}$) is divided into $h$ smaller chunks, one for each head. For example, $Q$ (shape `[batch_size, seq_len, hidden_dim]`) is reshaped to `[batch_size, seq_len, num_heads, head_dim]`, where `num_heads` is the number of heads and `head_dim` is the dimension of each head (`head_dim = hidden_dim / num_heads`).

We can then define $Q^i$, $K^i$, and $V^i$ as the $i$-th head (slice) from these reshaped tensors. The attention operation is then computed for each head independently:

$$
head_i = \text{Attention}(Q^i, K^i, V^i)
$$

The outputs of all heads ($head_1, ..., head_h$) are then concatenated back together (reversing the reshape) and passed through a final linear projection layer ($W^O$) to produce the final output:

$$
\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(head_1, ..., head_h)W^O
$$

It is important to note that while this architecture is "Multi-head," all $h$ heads can be computed efficiently in parallel within a single, large batched matrix multiplication (BMM), which is key to its performance on GPUs.

## Environment Setup

Follow these instructions to set up the project environment, especially if you are working on the ICE cluster.

> **Important:** We strongly recommend working on the **ICE cluster** with the provided GPUs. Local GPU environments (especially newer consumer GPUs) may have driver compatibility issues, and debugging tools like `cuda-gdb` and `compute-sanitizer` may not work correctly on all local setups. The ICE cluster is the officially supported environment for this project.

### 0. Allocate GPU Resources

First, allocate an interactive session.

**From the command line (via SSH):**
A typical allocation request for one GPU, 8 CPUs, and 128GB of memory for 4 hours looks like this:

```bash
salloc --gres=gpu:<gpu_name> --cpus-per-task=8 --mem=128G --time=4:00:00
```

Feel free to allocate other GPUs (rtx_6000, v100, a100, l40s, ...) if the latest GPUs (H100s) in PACE are too busy. 

**From the web:**
Alternatively, you can use the Open OnDemand website to request GPU allocation.

### 1. Cloning this repo

**Important: Use Scratch Directory on ICE Cluster**

When cloning this repository on the ICE cluster, make sure to work inside your scratch directory. Your home directory has only 30 GB of storage, while scratch provides up to 300 GB.

You can check your scratch path by running:

```bash
pace-quota
```

on any ICE node.

To simplify future access, consider creating a symlink from your home directory to your scratch directory:

```
ln -s /path/to/your/scratch ~/scratch
```

This ensures you always work within the larger storage space and avoid exceeding your home directory limit. Once this setup is done, please clone this repo and start working on this project. 

```bash
cd <path to your scratch directory>
git clone <URL_TO_THIS_REPO>
```

**Important:** The default home folder (`~/`) is NFS-based and has a very limited quota. Working from this directory will be very slow and may cause your programs to fail. Always use `~/scratch/` for your projects.

### 2. Load `uv`

To get started, you first need to load the `uv` module, which is a fast Python package installer and virtual environment manager.

```bash
module load uv
```

### 3. Create a Python virtual environment with `uv`

Next, create a new virtual environment and install the required packages.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment using Python 3.12
uv venv --python 3.12

# Activate the new environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the required libraries 
uv pip install --no-cache-dir torch numpy transformers tqdm

# Load CUDA module (Should be <=12.8)
module load cuda/12.6.1
```

### 4. For subsequent PACE logins

For any future sessions after you log out and log back into PACE, you only need to re-activate the virtual environment to get started:

```bash
module load uv
module load cuda/12.6.1
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Tasks

This project consists of 7 tasks and is worth 15 points. Tasks 3–7 are optional extra credit worth up to 15 additional points (see [Grading Policy](#grading-policy-for-spring-2026) below).

### Grading Policy for Spring 2026

This is the first release of this project, and we understand it can be quite challenging. To accommodate this, we have structured the grading as follows:

- **Task 1** is worth **5 points** and **Task 2** is worth **10 points**. These two tasks are **required** and make up the full 15 points for this project.
- **Tasks 3–7** are **optional** and worth a combined **15 extra credit points**. These extra points will be applied toward **Project 5**, effectively allowing you to skip some parts of Project 5 (20 points) if you earn the full amount.

In other words, if you complete only Tasks 1 and 2 correctly, you will receive full marks for this project. If you go further and complete Tasks 3–7, you can earn up to 15 bonus points that carry over to Project 5. However, we strongly encourage you to complete the entire project. This is the most ML-relevant project in the course, and you will learn a great deal from it.

---

### Task 1 (5 pts)

Your first task is to implement a naive, non-optimized self-attention operation in PyTorch. This will help you become familiar with the multi-headed self-attention mechanism.

You will implement your algorithm in the `forward()` method of `attention.py`. You can then use the provided `test.py` script to compare your results with PyTorch's built-in `torch.nn.MultiheadAttention` to verify correctness.

Here are the steps to follow:

1.  **Split Heads**: Use the `torch.Tensor.view()` method to reshape the input `q`, `k`, and `v` tensors. You will change their dimensions from `[batch_size, seq_len, hidden_dim]` to `[batch_size, seq_len, num_heads, head_dim]` to split the `hidden_dim` into multiple attention heads.

2.  **Transpose**: Use the `.transpose()` method to swap the sequence length and head dimensions. This changes the tensor shape to `[batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim]`, which is the standard layout for batched attention computation.

3.  **Compute Scores**: Compute the scaled dot-product attention scores. This is done by performing a matrix multiplication of $Q$ and $K^T$, and then scaling by the square root of the head dimension ($d_k$). You can achieve this using the `@` operator for matrix multiplication and `math.sqrt()` for scaling. The full operation is $QK^T / \sqrt{d}$.

4.  **Apply Causal Mask (if enabled)**: If the `causal=True` flag is passed to the function, you must apply a causal (look-ahead) mask.

- First, create the mask using `torch.triu` to get an upper-triangular matrix.
- Then, apply this mask to the score matrix using the `.masked_fill(mask, value)` method. You should fill the masked positions with `float('-inf')` to ensure they become zero after the softmax.

5.  **Apply Softmax**: Use the `torch.nn.functional.softmax()` (imported as `F`) to apply the softmax function to each row (i.e., along the last dimension) of the scaled and masked score matrix.

6.  **Compute Output**: Compute the final output matrix $O$ by multiplying the softmax-normalized attention weights with the `V` (Value) tensor. We have already provided the code for transposing and concatenating the heads back into the final output shape.

Once you have completed your implementation, please read through the test code in `test.py` to understand how it works. You can then run the test case from your terminal with the following command:

```bash
python -m task1.test
```

> Specify the device with `device="cuda"` when creating a tensor. `.to("cuda")` is another way of doing this, but it involves duplicate data in CPU and `cudaMemcpy` to move it to GPU, so it's inefficient. 

---

### Task 2 (10 pts)

In this task, you will implement a naive self-attention operation using a combination of PyTorch and your own custom **CUDA kernels**.

While we will continue to use the PyTorch framework for high-level evaluation, the core computations will be replaced by your CUDA code. These kernels will be bound to Python, allowing them to be called directly from the `attention.py` script instead of using standard PyTorch tensor operations. Please examine the `forward()` method to understand how this Python-CUDA binding is structured.

Your specific task is to complete the **`attention_kernel.cu`** file by implementing the following components.

**Kernel Pointer Shapes Reference:** Since CUDA kernels receive raw `float*` pointers (no PyTorch shape metadata), here are the tensor layouts. All tensors are row-major and contiguous.

| Kernel | Pointer | Logical Shape | Stride Between Batches |
|--------|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| `softmax_kernel_batched` | `inp`, `outp` | `(num_batch_heads, NUM_ROW, NUM_COL)` | `NUM_ROW * NUM_COL` |
| `GEMM_NT_kernel_batched` | `a_mat` | `(num_batch_heads, M, K)` | `M * K` |
| | `b_mat` | `(num_batch_heads, N, K)` — note: `N` rows of `K` cols, transposed during multiply | `N * K` |
| | `out_mat` | `(num_batch_heads, M, N)` | `M * N` |
| `GEMM_NN_kernel_batched` | `a_mat` | `(num_batch_heads, M, K)` | `M * K` |
| | `b_mat` | `(num_batch_heads, K, N)` | `K * N` |
| | `out_mat` | `(num_batch_heads, M, N)` | `M * N` |

The batch dimension is mapped to `blockIdx.z` in all kernels.

Steps to Follow:

1.  **Softmax Kernel**
    This kernel will compute the softmax function, which normalizes a vector of values into a probability distribution. To ensure **numerical stability**, your implementation must first find the maximum value of each input row, subtract it from all elements in that row, and *then* compute the exponent and sum. This two-pass approach prevents overflow or underflow issues with large input values.

    You must use **shared memory** (`__shared__`) to minimize costly global memory accesses. Implement techniques such as **parallel reduction** within a thread block to efficiently find the row maximum and, subsequently, the sum of the exponents.

    Finally, you must implement a **batched softmax kernel**. The design should map **one CUDA block to compute the softmax for one input row vector**. As you can observe from the `test_batched_softmax()` function, the `gridDim.x` (the first dimension of the grid) will correspond to the batch dimension.

2.  **GEMM Kernels**
    The full attention operation requires two distinct matrix multiplication (GEMM) steps: $S = QK^T$ and $O = SV$ (where $S$ is the softmax result). Instead of creating one complex kernel that handles transposition on the fly, you will implement two separate, optimized GEMM kernels:

      * **`GEMM_NT`**: Performs `A @ B.T` (Normal-Transposed). This kernel will be used for the $QK^T$ computation.
      * **`GEMM_NN`**: Performs `A @ B` (Normal-Normal). This kernel will be used for the $SV$ computation.

    > **Note on Matrix Layout:** Our `N` (Normal) and `T` (Transposed) notation differs from the cuBLAS convention. In PyTorch and our CUDA implementation, matrices are **row-major** by default. Therefore, `N` signifies a row-major matrix, and `T` signifies a column-major (transposed row-major) matrix.

    For the implementation, you must use the standard **tiled-GEMM** approach (as you learned in Project 1). This involves using shared memory to stage tiles of the input matrices, which significantly reduces global memory bandwidth and improves performance. Pay close attention to the test code to determine how batching is handled in the kernel launch parameters.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the kernel grid configuration, **`blockIdx.x` corresponds to the column (N) dimension and `blockIdx.y` corresponds to the row (M) dimension**. This ordering ensures that consecutive threads (adjacent `threadIdx.x`) access consecutive columns in memory, enabling coalesced memory access for row-major matrices. The batch dimension is mapped to `blockIdx.z` in all kernels.

3.  **Attention Computation**
    Finally, you will assemble the full operation inside the `custom_attention()` host function in `attention_kernel.cu`. You must call your newly implemented kernels in the correct sequence.

    We have provided the `scale_and_causal_mask` kernel for you. You must call this kernel after your $QK^T$ (GEMM\_NT) computation to perform both the scaling (division by $\sqrt{d}$) and the application of the causal mask (if enabled).

    It is your responsibility to choose the correct block size, grid size, and tile size (`TILE_SIZE`) for all kernel launches. If you are unsure about the launch configuration, study the testing functions in `test.py` for guidance.

To test your code, you must first compile the CUDA kernels. The provided script handles the PyTorch C++ extension building process.

```bash
# Compile the CUDA kernels
python -m task2.compile 
```

After a successful compilation, you can test your individual kernels to isolate any issues:

```bash
# Test only the batched softmax kernel
python -m task2.test --softmax

# Test only the batched GEMM kernels
python -m task2.test --gemm
```

Once your individual kernels are passing, you can test the full end-to-end attention kernel.

```bash
# Test the complete custom attention implementation
python -m task2.test --attention
```

**Note:** This CUDA implementation in Task 2 still involves multiple separate kernel calls (GEMM, scale/mask, softmax, GEMM). Because each kernel launch has overhead, we are not expecting to see significant performance benefits over PyTorch just yet.

---

### Task 3 (3 pts, extra credit)

Now, you will implement the **FlashAttention 2** algorithm in PyTorch. This task is similar in spirit to Task 1 (as it's a PyTorch-only implementation), but the logic is significantly more complex. Your goal here is to understand and implement the attention operation in a **tiled manner**, which is the key to its efficiency.

Your implementation must follow **Algorithm 1** from the paper "[FlashAttention-2: Faster Attention with Better Parallelism and Work Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08691)" by Tri Dao.

Here are a few notes about the Algorithm:

  * We strongly suggest you first read the original [FlashAttention-1 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135), [this article](https://gordicaleksa.medium.com/eli5-flash-attention-5c44017022ad), and [these lecture notes from UW CSE 599M](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse599m/23sp/notes/flashattn.pdf). These will help you understand *why* this tiled approach, which avoids materializing the massive intermediate $N \times N$ matrices in global memory, is so much faster than the naive PyTorch implementation from Task 1 that requires multiple separate kernel calls.

  * You will be implementing the **forward pass** only, so you can safely ignore the $L$ (log-sum-exp) statistic in Algorithm 1, which is primarily saved for the backward pass.

  * If you trace through Algorithm 1 and carefully track the intermediate values and their tensor dimensions, you should be able to implement the logic in Python without too much difficulty.

  * Be sure to include scaling by the head dimension (divide by $\sqrt{d}$) after computing $QK^T$, as this step is omitted from the paper's algorithm.

  * The Python version of FlashAttention-2 mirrors the algorithmic structure of the CUDA kernel, including **an outer loop over each head and two inner loops over Q and KV tiles**. In CUDA, this outer loop is parallelized across thread blocks, but in Python, it must run sequentially. This implementation is intentionally not optimized for speed; it may even run slower than naive attention due to additional kernel launches. Don't focus on performance for now — the intention of this task is to illustrate the tiling, blockwise softmax, and streaming logic, making the transition to writing CUDA kernels clearer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Typo in Paper!**
> There is a well-known typo in Algorithm 1 of the original paper. Please refer to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/issues/991) for the correction.

**Tips for PyTorch Implementation:** The notation $\mathrm{diag}(v)A$ on lines 10 and 12 may look confusing. This represents a diagonal matrix (formed from vector $v$) multiplied by a dense matrix $A$. However, if you think about it closely, this is simply an element-wise multiplication per row. This is very easy to implement in PyTorch using broadcasting.

  * For $\mathrm{diag}(v)A$, you can use: `A * v.unsqueeze(-1)`
  * Similarly, for $\mathrm{diag}(v)^{-1}A$, you can use: `A / v.unsqueeze(-1)`

To test the functionality of your implementation, run the following command:

```bash
python -m task3.test
```

---

### Task 4 (4 pts, extra credit)

This is the most important task. You will now implement the full **FlashAttention** algorithm in PyTorch + CUDA.

Your goal is to translate the tiled logic you developed in Task 3 (the PyTorch FlashAttention-2 algorithm) into a single, high-performance CUDA kernel. This fused kernel will perform the entire attention computation (GEMMs, masking, softmax, and output GEMM) in one pass, using tiling to avoid materializing the large $N \times N$ matrices in global memory.

You must use the pre-defined shared memory arrays to store blocks of Q, K, and V. You can assume for your implementation that the maximum `head_dim` will be 128.

**Kernel Pointer Shapes Reference:** The host function reshapes the input tensors before passing them to your kernel. All pointers are row-major and contiguous.

| Pointer | Logical Shape | Stride Between Batch-Heads |
|---------|---------------|---------------------------|
| `q`, `k`, `v` | `(batch_size * num_heads, seq_len, head_dim)` | `seq_len * head_dim` |
| `out` | `(batch_size * num_heads, seq_len, head_dim)` | `seq_len * head_dim` |

To index element `(bh, row, col)`: `ptr[bh * seq_len * head_dim + row * head_dim + col]`.

A critical part of this task is performance tuning. In the `custom_flash_attention()` host function, you must experiment with and **tune the tile sizes** (`B_r` and `B_c`, the block sizes for rows and columns) to find the configuration that achieves the best performance on your GPU.

> **Design Note:** When designing your kernel, keep in mind that in Task 5 you will need to adapt it for a decode kernel where the Q sequence length is always 1. Avoid designs that fundamentally require multiple Q rows per thread block (e.g., assigning exactly one row per thread), as they will not generalize to the decode case.

**Testing Your Kernel**: First, compile your new CUDA kernel with the following command.

```bash
python -m task4.compile
```

Then, run the test and benchmarking script:

```bash
python -m task4.test
```

The test code will verify the correctness of your output and then compare the performance of your custom FlashAttention kernel against your naive CUDA self-attention implementation from Task 2.

**Grading:** Your grade for this task will partly depend on the speedup you achieve. The speedup is measured on Vocareum (our GPU autograding system), but we will not set the bar too strictly — correctness is the priority here. Note that the GPU on ICE and Vocareum may differ, so achieving the same speedup on both machines may not always be straightforward.

**Expected speedup ranges (on H100):** As a rough reference, a correct implementation should achieve approximately **1.0-1.1x** speedup for the small configuration (batch=4, seq=1024) and **1.3-1.9x** for the large configuration (batch=4, seq=4096) in both non-causal / causal cases. The speedup may vary per GPU, but the trend should be similar. If your numbers are significantly outside these ranges, double-check your kernel for correctness or adjust the tile size.

---

### Task 5 (4 pts, extra credit)

This task focuses on the second phase of LLM inference: **token generation (decode)**, and how to optimize it using a **KV Cache**.

**How LLMs Generate New Tokens**

LLM token generation is a two-step process:

1.  **Prefill Phase:** We run the full self-attention (as in Task 4) on the entire input prompt (e.g., 1024 tokens) to generate the *first* new token.
2.  **Decode Phase:** To generate every subsequent token, we append the *newest* token to our input sequence and run the attention operation again.

However, since we use **causal attention**, old tokens can *never* attend to new tokens. Only the single, newest token needs to attend to all the previous tokens (including itself). This insight changes the computation dramatically:

  * Instead of a full matrix-matrix multiply (GEMM), the attention computation for the new token is effectively a **matrix-vector multiply (GEMV)**.

This is much faster, but we still need the Key (K) and Value (V) matrices from all the old tokens. To avoid recomputing them at every step, we store them in a **KV Cache** and simply reuse them.

  * **To better understand KV Caching, please refer to this article:** [link](https://medium.com/@joaolages/kv-caching-explained-276520203249)

**Your Task**

Go through `attention.py` and `test.py` to understand the new workflow. You will see that it first generates Q, K, and V. Then, it uses a CUDA kernel to **update** (append) the newest K and V vectors into the KV cache. Finally, it runs a new **decode kernel** using the single new Q and the *entire* K and V from the cache.

**Kernel Pointer Shapes Reference:** All pointers are row-major and contiguous.

| Kernel | Pointer | Logical Shape | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------------|-------|
| `update_cache_kernel` | `k_cache`, `v_cache` | `(batch_size, max_seq_len, hidden_dim)` | Pre-allocated cache |
| | `k`, `v` | `(batch_size, 1, hidden_dim)` | New token's K/V (squeezed to 2D) |
| `flash_attention_decode_kernel` | `q` | `(batch_size * num_heads, 1, head_dim)` | Single query token |
| | `k`, `v` | `(batch_size * num_heads, seq_len, head_dim)` | Full cached KV |
| | `out` | `(batch_size * num_heads, 1, head_dim)` | Single output token |

Note that `update_cache_kernel` operates on the **full `hidden_dim`** (before head splitting), while `flash_attention_decode_kernel` operates **per-head** on `head_dim` (after the host function splits heads).

**Step 1: Implement `update_cache_kernel()`**

Your first task is to write the `update_cache_kernel()` in CUDA. This kernel's simple job is to copy the *new* K and V vectors (from the current step) into the correct slot in the `kv_cache` tensor, based on the current token index.

We do this because we don't want to allocate and free new memory blocks at every decode step, as that would be extremely slow. Instead, we pre-allocate a fixed, large amount of memory for the KV cache (up to a `max_seq_len`) and just write into it.

> This method can become inefficient if the allocated `max_seq_len` is much larger than the real sequence length. The state-of-the-art solution to this problem is **PagedAttention**. If you are interested, please look into the [PagedAttention paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180).

**Step 2: Implement the Decode Kernel**

Your second task is to modify the FlashAttention kernel you built in **Task 4** and turn it into a specialized kernel for the decode phase.

The main change is that you can now **assume the Q tensor's sequence length is always 1**. This greatly simplifies your kernel's logic. The core FlashAttention concepts (tiling, shared memory, online softmax) are the same, but this assumption will likely **eliminate one of the main `for` loops** in your implementation (the one that iterates over blocks of Q, $B_r$).

**Testing and Performance**

After implementing both kernels, you will be able to run `test.py`. This test will:

1.  Run a **prefill** on 1024 tokens.
2.  Use your `update_cache_kernel` and `decode_kernel` to **generate 100 new tokens**, one by one.

Again, try **tuning the tile size** (`B_r` and `B_c`) in your decode kernel for the best performance. Be aware that a tile size that is too large may blow up the shared memory.

> **Performance Hint:** In the decode kernel, you may need to perform cross-thread reductions (e.g., computing a global max or sum from per-thread partial results). A naive approach where a single thread loops over all partial values is `O(N)`. A **parallel tree reduction** brings this down to `O(log N)` steps by having threads cooperatively halve the problem size at each step. This is a well-known CUDA pattern — see the [NVIDIA parallel reduction whitepaper](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/cuda/files/reduction.pdf) for details.

**Compile and run the test:**

```bash
python -m task5.compile
```

```bash
python -m task5.test
```

The test script will compare the performance of your FlashAttention prefill and decode kernels against your naive CUDA self-attention from Task 2.

**Grading:** Your grade for this task will partly depend on the speedup you achieve. The speedup is measured on Vocareum, but we will not set the bar too strictly — correctness is the priority here. Note that the GPU on ICE and Vocareum may differ, so achieving the same speedup on both machines may not always be straightforward.

**Expected speedup ranges (on H100):** As a rough reference, a correct implementation should achieve approximately **30-80x** speedup for the TBT (time between token) metric. The speedup primarily results from caching the KV's, rather than recomputing them at each decoding step. If your numbers are significantly outside these ranges, double-check your kernel for correctness or adjust the tile size.

**(Optional) Optimizing the Decode Kernel**

Explore performance improvements to the decode stage by implementing a chunked FlashAttention kernel, as described in Stanford CRFM’s FlashDecoding article ([link](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/10/12/flashdecoding.html)). Compare its performance against the baseline decode kernel to quantify potential speedups.

### Task 6 (3 pts, extra credit)

This task brings all your work together. You will now implement an **end-to-end LLM inference pipeline** on a dummy LLM.

Your objective is to fill in the `forward()` method of the `customAttention` class. This single function must now be able to intelligently handle *both* the prefill and decode phases of inference.

> **Hint:** Look at the `decode` parameter already passed to `forward()`. You can use this flag to determine which phase you are in.

Specifically, your `forward()` method must:

1.  **Handle the Prefill Phase:** When `decode=False`, call your optimized **Task 4 FlashAttention kernel** to process the full prompt.
2.  **Handle the Decode Phase:** When `decode=True`, call your specialized **Task 5 decode kernel**, using the provided KV cache.
3.  **Manage the Cache:** During the decode phase, it must correctly call your `update_kv_cache` (from Task 5) to append the newly computed K and V vectors to the cache, making them available for the *next* decode step. During the prefill phase, it must store the current K and V vectors into the cache for future use.

**Testing and Reporting**

The test script for this task simulates a full generative inference loop, generating 100 tokens:

```bash
python -m task6.test
```

This test will measure two key performance metrics:

  * **TTFT (Time To First Token):** This measures the performance of your **prefill kernel (Task 4)**.
  * **TBT (Time Between Tokens):** This measures the average performance of your **decode kernel (Task 5)** over many steps.

### Task 7 (1 pt, extra credit)

This task is a demo to see your kernels working in a **real end-to-end LLM inference pipeline** with a Hugging Face model. You will see your custom attention kernel generating real tokens!

We have provided all the code for you, which attaches your **prefill (Task 4)** and **decode (Task 5)** kernels to a GPT-2 model. There is nothing new for you to code.

Your only job here is to run the model and verify that it works correctly. Make sure that your LLM is generating something useful and coherent. **If it generates random, noisy tokens,** it means your attention kernel has a bug. You will need to go back and debug your CUDA implementations from Tasks 4 and 5.

**Running the Demo**

To run the inference with *your* custom kernels:

```bash
python -m task7.inference
```


**Verifying Correctness**

You might observe that the GPT-2 model generates sentences that are not factually correct. This is expected, as GPT-2 is an older model.

The important thing is to check if *your* model's "intelligence" matches the *original* GPT-2. To do this, you can run the reference implementation, which uses the standard Hugging Face attention:

```bash
python -m task7.inference_ref
```

Please check whether you think the two models are "equally intelligent." If your model (`task7.inference`) seems significantly dumber or produces nonsensical garbage compared to the reference, go back and check your kernel implementations for bugs.

## CUDA Debugging Tips

Debugging CUDA kernels can be challenging since errors often manifest as silently wrong results rather than crashes. Here are some tips:

* **`printf()` in kernels:** You can use `printf()` inside CUDA kernels to print values from specific threads. Use small test cases (e.g., `batch_size=1, seq_len=16`) and print from a single thread (e.g., `if (threadIdx.x == 0 && blockIdx.x == 0)`) to avoid flooding the output.

* **`compute-sanitizer`:** Run your test with `compute-sanitizer python -m taskN.test` to detect out-of-bounds memory accesses and race conditions. This is the equivalent of Valgrind for CUDA.

* **Common pitfalls:**
  - Missing `__syncthreads()` after shared memory loads — causes race conditions that produce intermittent wrong results
  - Off-by-one errors in tile boundary checks — causes out-of-bounds reads that may silently return garbage
  - Wrong indexing when computing batched offsets (forgetting to account for `blockIdx.z` or the batch stride)
  - Using the wrong dimension for M, N, K in GEMM kernels — test with non-square matrices to catch this

* **Shared memory bank conflicts:** NVIDIA GPUs have 32 shared memory banks, each 4 bytes wide. When multiple threads in a warp access different addresses on the same bank, the accesses get serialized. This is especially common with 2D shared memory arrays like `tile[ROW][COL]` where `COL` is a multiple of 32 — every row maps to the same bank pattern. A simple fix is to pad the inner dimension by 1 (e.g., `tile[ROW][COL + 1]`), which shifts each row's bank alignment and eliminates conflicts.

* **Incremental testing:** Test your kernels individually (e.g., `python -m task2.test --softmax`, then `--gemm`) before testing the full attention pipeline. This isolates which component has the bug.

## Submissions

We will use **Vocareum** for autograding. To access Vocareum, go to Canvas and find the Vocareum menu on the lower left sidebar. If this is your first time using Vocareum, you may need to set up your account. After that, click the course name **CS 7295** and navigate to **Project 4**. This will open a Jupyter Notebook session. You can click the **JupyterLab** button in the top left corner to switch to JupyterLab.

> Although you can complete all your work directly in Vocareum, we strongly recommend writing your code locally in ICE and then copying your solution into Vocareum. The Vocareum environment can be **unstable** and **occasionally crash**, resulting in lost work.

The Vocareum grading script evaluates your submission using two criteria. First, it checks whether your code is **functionally** correct. Second, it verifies that your implementation is **fast** enough when compared to naive PyTorch or CUDA implementations.

### What you need to do

1. Copy the code you wrote for the assignment into the corresponding files in Vocareum using JupyterLab.
   For Parts 1 through 6 (Part 7 does not require coding), you should already know which files you modified. Fill in the appropriate `TODO` sections in each file.

2. Open the main `.ipynb` file and run every cell from top to bottom.
   You can do this by repeatedly clicking the **Run Cell** button until you reach the end. This step ensures that your code compiles and runs correctly. The full execution usually takes 5 to 10 minutes.

   **Note:** For Parts 4 and 5, the grading container has limited GPU resources. You may encounter compilation errors if your code uses too much shared memory. This behavior is expected, as the grading environment is less powerful than the H100 GPU. If this happens, reduce the block size before launching the kernel.

3. Click the **Submit** button in the top right corner.
   This will upload your code to the grading container, where it will be evaluated automatically. The grading process can take 10 to 20 minutes. You can close the window and return later to check the logs and scores in Vocareum.

If you run into issues that you cannot resolve on your own, please create a post on Ed or email me at euijun@gatech.edu.

Finally, feel free to submit pull requests to this repository to improve this README. If you notice any errors or think additional explanations or resources would be helpful for future students, your contributions are welcome.
